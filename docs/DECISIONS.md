# Architecture and Product Decision Log

This file records durable decisions that future agents should not casually reverse.

## D-001 — Build from scratch

Status: accepted

Decision: Build the EHR as a new product rather than extending OpenEMR or another existing EHR codebase.

Reason: The defining interaction and AI architecture are substantially different from conventional EHR assumptions. Starting from a legacy product would risk allowing its information architecture and workflows to dictate the new product.

## D-002 — Workspace-first interaction model

Status: accepted

Decision: Treat each patient chart as a persistent workspace. Support multiple simultaneously open patient workspaces with browser-like navigation.

Reason: The patient's active clinical state is the primary cognitive unit of work, not the software module.

## D-003 — AI is a cross-cutting layer

Status: accepted

Decision: AI will be integrated throughout relevant clinical and operational workflows rather than existing only as a standalone chatbot.

Reason: The largest value comes from reducing synthesis, retrieval, documentation, and workflow burden in context.

Constraint: AI output is not automatically authoritative clinical data.

## D-004 — Structured clinical data remains authoritative

Status: accepted

Decision: The patient record and domain state must exist independently of an LLM conversation or generated summary.

Reason: Clinical data requires auditability, deterministic retrieval, interoperability, and durable state beyond any one AI model.

## D-005 — FHIR at boundaries, not as the UI architecture

Status: accepted

Decision: Design for FHIR compatibility/interoperability but do not force UI components or the internal clinician workflow to mirror FHIR resources.

Reason: Interoperability is necessary, but an exchange standard should not dictate the clinician experience.

## D-006 — Vendor integrations use adapters

Status: accepted

Decision: E-prescribing, EPCS, labs, claims/clearinghouse, communications, payments, scheduling, and other external systems should connect through replaceable adapters/interfaces.

Reason: Core EHR behavior must remain portable if pricing, contracts, APIs, or vendors change.

## D-007 — Synthetic data until security foundation exists

Status: accepted

Decision: Early prototypes use fictional patient data only.

Real PHI is out of scope until authentication, authorization, audit logging, encryption, secrets handling, backup/recovery, retention, and HIPAA-appropriate infrastructure have been intentionally implemented and reviewed.

## D-008 — Human confirmation for consequential AI actions

Status: accepted

Decision: AI may prepare consequential clinical/financial workflows, but explicit authorized-user action is required before committing or sending them.

Examples include note signing, prescriptions, EPCS actions, orders, committed diagnosis changes, result acknowledgement, external patient messages, and claim submission.

## D-009 — Start single-clinician, avoid single-clinician dead ends

Status: accepted

Decision: Optimize the first usable product for one psychiatric clinician while keeping core domain, authorization, data, and integration architecture capable of later supporting multiple providers and organizations.

Reason: A focused first user enables rapid workflow learning without requiring premature enterprise complexity.

## D-010 — Direct-to-main agent workflow

Status: accepted

Decision: For agent-assisted GitHub work, changes are made directly to `main` unless Logan explicitly requests a branch or pull request.

GitHub `main` is the source of truth. Validation remains required after meaningful changes.

Reason: This is the owner's preferred early-stage workflow while the project is small and rapidly evolving.

## D-011 — Patient workspaces can detach into floating windows

Status: accepted

Decision: Patient tabs may be torn out of the primary tab strip into movable, resizable floating windows inside the EHR and later returned to the tab strip. Floating patient windows should behave like familiar desktop/browser windows: drag by the title bar, resize from every edge and corner, minimize, maximize/restore, close, move to front when activated, and navigate backward through that window's recent local views.

Reason: The clinician may need more than one patient workspace visible at the same time for comparison, reference, messages, labs, or related work. Free positioning allows those workspaces to overlap, tile, or partially occupy the screen without forcing a rigid split layout. Keeping these windows inside the application preserves EHR context and creates a cleaner future boundary for authentication, PHI handling, permissions, audit behavior, and AI context than spawning unmanaged browser windows.

Constraint: Each visible window must retain unambiguous patient identity and local workspace state. Future production AI/context routing must never confuse which patient window an action belongs to. The chart interior remains interactive content; window resize behavior belongs to the perimeter rather than consuming clicks inside clinical forms.

## D-012 — Elastic Complexity & Dynamic Workspace Modularity

Status: accepted

Decision: The EHR interface must scale elastically from an ultra-minimal, distraction-free "Zen" writing pad to a high-density, multi-metric clinical cockpit. All workspace modules, dashboard widgets, and overview cards must support direct in-line reordering (`▲`/`▼`), collapsing, and hiding, as well as natural language AI layout reconfiguration. Built-in clinical presets (`Standard Balanced`, `Minimal / Zen Focus`, `Comprehensive Intake`, `Fast Med Check`) and custom user-saved presets are persisted across sessions.

Reason: Clinical workflows and provider specialties vary radically. Forcing a single rigid layout or fixed density on all clinicians produces cognitive overload, visual fatigue, and administrative burnout. Allowing clinicians and ambient AI to reshape the screen ensures maximum focus during patient encounters while retaining instant access to high-velocity clinical tools when needed.

Constraint: Clinical safety invariants (e.g. overdue lab warnings, allergy alerts, unsigned notes) must remain auditable and never be silently dropped when switching to minimal density modes.
